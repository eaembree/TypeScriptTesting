# TypeScriptTesting

Repository of some type script examples for my own reference and edification while learning TypeScript.

These examples require installation of TypeScript.

To install TypeScript you need to install Node.js to get npm. Then run the following command from the level of the repo:
* npm install -g typescript (this one doesn't need to be at the project level)

Editor used: VS Code
